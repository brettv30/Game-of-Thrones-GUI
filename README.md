# Game of Thrones GUI

Here is an interactive Game of Thrones GUI that I created as a final project for my Advanced Java course. The concepts used in this project are OOP, Inheritance, Aggregation, Enumerated Data Types, Array manipulation, GUI development, and Image handling. 

The application allows the player to enter their name, choose their house, number of family members, social standing, and other fun little things. At the end of the application, it displays this information in a nice summary for the user to read. 

I have also included the UML diagram for this project to show the relationships between each object in the application.
